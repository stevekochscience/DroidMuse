DroidMuse is my very first Android project, and is centered around
building UI components for music related applications. 

Much of its current state (as of 10/17/2011) is the result of a trial
and error coding process as I became more familiar with Android development
and as such it is a little rough around the edges. 

I am currently in the process of refactoring the various elements 
into reusable components for other projects.
